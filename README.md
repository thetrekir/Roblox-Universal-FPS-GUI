# Universal FPS GUI | By Thetrekir

A straightforward, universal cheating interface for Roblox FPS games.

## Features

*   **Aimbot:** Includes FOV circle, smoothness, bullet prediction, and wallcheck.
*   **Triggerbot:** Features customizable delay and randomization for a more natural look.
*   **Visuals (ESP):** R6/R15 skeletons, boxes, head circles, viewlines, snaplines, HP, and distance info. Automatically filters out teammates (TeamCheck).

## Notes (Read Before Using)

*   **Triggerbot:** It is very basic. It gets the job done but don't expect top-tier
*   **Optimization:** The ESP is not fully optimized. It will likely drop your FPS in crowded servers. I am aware of this, but I have no plans to fix or optimize it. 

## Requirements
